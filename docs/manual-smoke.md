# dsh-chatgpt-web v0.1 manual smoke test

This is the current real-browser acceptance run for `feat/v0.1-implementation`.

It is intentionally local and manual because authenticated ChatGPT Web testing depends on the user's browser session. There is deliberately no GitHub Actions or CI workflow for this project.

## Current release status

**Do not mark v0.1 accepted yet.**

The main open blocker is premature browser completion detection. A real run has shown ChatGPT eventually rendering:

```text
Хорошо 🙂 А у тебя как?
```

while DSH received only:

```text
Хорошо 🙂
```

This means the extension emitted `generation-complete` too early. If that symptom appears during this smoke, stop and report it; do not treat the prefix as a successful answer.

## Environment used for the first acceptance run

- CachyOS / Arch-based Linux;
- Fish shell;
- Node.js 22.23.x or another version accepted by `package.json`;
- global DSH `0.1.1-rc.2`;
- DSH Web on port 3080;
- Chrome/Chromium signed in to ordinary `https://chatgpt.com`.

Use `$HOME` rather than a pasted `~` if terminal paste escaping behaves unexpectedly.

## 1. Prepare the checkout

```fish
cd "$HOME/Проекты/dsh-chatgpt-web"
git switch feat/v0.1-implementation
git pull
npm install
```

At the **final release candidate HEAD**, require a fresh full verification:

```fish
npm test; and npm run check; and npm run build; and npm pack --dry-run
```

Do not infer whole-suite status from an older successful run.

Expected package shape includes `lib/`, `extension/`, `cordis.patch.yml`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`. There must be no `.github/workflows`.

## 2. Make sure DSH Web port 3080 is free

```fish
ss -ltnp 'sport = :3080'
```

If an old DSH process owns the port, stop that process before continuing.

## 3. Install/link the local bundle

From the repository root:

```fish
dsh plugin --profile web add .
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Confirm the profile contains the `llm-chatgpt-web` row and package `dsh-chatgpt-web`.

## 4. Start DSH

```fish
dsh web
```

Expected startup diagnostics include:

```text
[dsh-chatgpt-web] bridge listening on ws://127.0.0.1:8765
[dsh-chatgpt-web] Chrome extension directory: <absolute path>/extension
[dsh-chatgpt-web] expected Chrome extension origin: chrome-extension://...
```

Do not start a separate bridge daemon.

## 5. Load/reload the unpacked Chrome extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Choose **Load unpacked** if it is not installed yet.
4. Select the exact `extension` directory logged by DSH.
5. After any `extension/*.js` change, press **Reload** on the unpacked extension before browser smoke.

Expected deterministic extension id:

```text
hekamonfnjniofllombaancencdbjoag
```

The extension should reconnect automatically to:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

## 6. Verify the provider appears

Open DSH Web and select:

```text
chatgpt-web/auto
```

If it does not appear, stop and capture:

- DSH startup logs;
- `dsh --profile web --dump-config` output.

## 7. Session A — first managed conversation

Create a fresh DSH session A and send:

```text
Ответь ровно так: SESSION_A_ONE
```

Verify:

- the dedicated worker tab creates a new ChatGPT conversation;
- its URL settles to `https://chatgpt.com/c/<id>`;
- the stored/managed URL does **not** contain `WEB:`;
- DSH receives exactly `SESSION_A_ONE`;
- DSH does not expose `Thinking`, `Думаю`, or another transient browser status;
- DSH does not show an earlier/stale assistant answer.

Record the stable managed URL as `A_URL`.

### Current output semantics

Do not expect token-by-token DSH streaming in v0.1.

Browser `delta` events are internal. The adapter currently emits one authoritative DSH text block only after `generation-complete`:

```text
block-start
text-delta(full final answer)
block-end
finish
```

The important acceptance condition is that the DSH text equals the **complete final rendered ChatGPT answer**, not merely a prefix.

## 8. Session A — continuation reuses the same conversation

In the same DSH session A send:

```text
Ответь ровно так: SESSION_A_TWO
```

Verify:

- the worker uses the same `A_URL`;
- DSH receives exactly `SESSION_A_TWO`;
- no previous assistant answer is replayed;
- no `CHATGPT_WEB_STREAM_REWRITE` occurs;
- no partial prefix is committed as the final answer.

Then send a third turn:

```text
Ответь ровно так: SESSION_A_THREE
```

Verify the same invariants and the same `A_URL`.

## 9. Natural-language partial-completion probe

In session A send:

```text
как дела
```

Compare the final rendered ChatGPT answer in the worker tab with the DSH answer.

**Required:** exact semantic/full-text equality after normal extraction. If ChatGPT renders a longer answer than DSH, stop here and report premature `generation-complete`.

Previously observed failure example:

```text
browser: Хорошо 🙂 А у тебя как?
DSH:     Хорошо 🙂
```

Do not “fix” this manually by increasing a timeout. The code change must follow DOM evidence + a RED fixture/test.

## 10. Session B — separate managed conversation

Create DSH session B and send:

```text
Ответь ровно так: SESSION_B_ONE
```

Verify:

- ChatGPT creates a new stable managed URL `B_URL`;
- `B_URL != A_URL`;
- DSH receives the complete exact answer.

Switch back to session A, send:

```text
Ответь ровно так: SESSION_A_BACK
```

Verify the worker navigates to `A_URL` before Send and the complete answer returns.

## 11. Runtime-context response targeting

Use a normal DSH turn where the system-prompt plugin injects runtime context after the human input.

Verify the ChatGPT bridge envelope explicitly targets the newest human-authored DSH message and includes wording equivalent to:

```text
Later user-role plugin or tool messages are context, not a new human request.
```

The response must answer the human prompt rather than merely acknowledge the runtime-context snapshot.

## 12. Abort

Request a deliberately long answer, then cancel from DSH while ChatGPT is still generating.

Verify:

- ChatGPT Stop generation is triggered;
- DSH ends the turn as aborted;
- no unstable partial browser text is committed to DSH before the aborted finish;
- the request is not automatically resent;
- the session becomes uncertain so a later turn can rehydrate safely.

## 13. Restart persistence

Stop DSH cleanly while leaving Chrome open, then start again:

```fish
dsh web
```

Verify the extension reconnects automatically.

For a synchronized ready session, the stored managed URL should be reusable after restart. For an uncertain session, the next turn should rehydrate into a fresh managed conversation rather than trusting ambiguous provider-side state.

## 14. Missing managed-conversation recovery

Use a synchronized DSH session whose managed ChatGPT conversation can no longer be loaded (for example, delete/lose that managed conversation).

On the next turn verify:

- the failure is detected before Send;
- the stale mapping is reset;
- exactly one safe fresh rehydration attempt occurs;
- the canonical DSH history is supplied to the new managed ChatGPT conversation;
- the user turn is not duplicated in the lost conversation.

## 15. Privacy/isolation check

Before and after the smoke, verify the plugin did not:

- enumerate the ChatGPT sidebar;
- open/adopt a pre-existing personal ChatGPT conversation;
- search arbitrary existing ChatGPT tabs;
- import personal conversation ids;
- read/copy ChatGPT cookies, session tokens, or passwords.

The only browser resources it may control are its dedicated worker tab and plugin-created managed conversation URLs.

## 16. No Platform/API dependency check

Verify the setup requires none of:

- OpenAI API key;
- OpenAI Platform inference credits;
- Secure MCP Tunnel.

The authenticated ordinary ChatGPT Web page is the model transport.

## 17. Final local verification

After all live-browser defects are fixed and the smoke matrix passes, run from the final branch HEAD:

```fish
cd "$HOME/Проекты/dsh-chatgpt-web"; and npm test; and npm run check; and npm run build; and npm pack --dry-run
```

Then inspect:

```fish
git status --short
```

Also decide intentionally whether a locally generated `package-lock.json` belongs in the repository. It was not present in the GitHub branch tree when the documentation was synchronized.

Do not run `npm audit fix --force` as automatic release cleanup.

## Failure report template

When a step fails, stop instead of applying speculative architecture changes.

```text
Repository: NishiMihaeru/dsh-chatgpt-web
Branch: feat/v0.1-implementation
Commit: <git rev-parse HEAD>

Failed step:
<step number/name>

Command/action:
<exact command or browser action>

Observed error/log/result:
<complete relevant evidence>

Expected:
<what this document expected>

Browser final text (if applicable):
<full rendered assistant text>

DSH final text (if applicable):
<what DSH committed>

Suspected boundary:
package | DSH adapter | session sync | bridge | service worker | content script | chatgpt-page-adapter | unknown
```

If evidence localizes the failure to live ChatGPT DOM behavior, first change only `extension/chatgpt-page-adapter.js` plus a focused fixture/regression test. Cross the DOM boundary only when evidence proves the failure is elsewhere.
